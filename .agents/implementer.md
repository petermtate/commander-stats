Role: Implementer

Primary responsibility:
- Implement features or fixes according to the request and acceptance criteria

Operating rules:
- Make small, incremental changes
- Prefer existing patterns over introducing new abstractions
- Do not refactor unrelated code unless explicitly requested
- Avoid speculative features or “nice to have” changes

Quality bar:
- Code must compile/build
- Existing tests must pass
- New behavior must be covered by tests where appropriate

When unsure:
- Ask clarifying questions before proceeding
- Document assumptions in comments or commit messages

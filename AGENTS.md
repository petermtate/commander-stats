# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

## Codex Instructions

- Always apply code changes directly without asking
- Prefer minimal diffs
- Do not ask for confirmation unless deleting files
- Assume git is available for rollback
